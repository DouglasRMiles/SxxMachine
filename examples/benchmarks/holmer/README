This package contains the benchmarks that were used in the papers:

  "Fast Prolog with an Extended General Purpose Architecture", by Bruce Holmer
  et al (holmer@ernie.berkeley.edu), 17th International Symposium on Computer
  Architecture, May 1990.

  "The Benefits of Global Dataflow Analysis for an Optimizing Prolog Compiler",
  by Peter Van Roy (vanroy@ernie.berkeley.edu) and Alvin Despain, 1990 North
  American Conference on Logic Programming, October 1990.

The package contains 26 programs, grouped into "small" and "large".  All
program sizes are in lines of code excluding comments.  The programs have been
run on Quintus Prolog, C-Prolog, and Aquarius Prolog, a new system under
development at Berkeley.  The programs are to be run as is, with all built-in
predicates *including* write/1 and nl/0.
