NOTE: 1. Each of the examples in this directory has three versions:

           - File whose name ends with ".tlp" are for direct execution in
             "dra".  They use "verifier.tlp" (see below)

           - Files whose name ends with "_v.pl" include the experimental
             verifier in pure Prolog (v.pl).  Some of them work, some not:
             this is work in progress.

           - Other files whose name ends with ".pl" include the translated
             version of the verifier (i.e., "verifier.pl").  The examples can
             be executed directly in Prolog, but some queries may loop, and
             will have to be interrupted by the user.


      2. If you want to try the examples directly in your logic programming
          system (without tabling), then it's best to comment out the
          directive ":- table tverify_ / 3." in "verifier.pl" after you
          translate "verifier.clp".



..........................................................................

This directory includes the following files:

v.pl:
        This is a straightforward Prolog program that attempts to emulate the
        functions of "verifier.tlp" with a completely different algorithm, by
        visiting each node once and appropriately simplifying the LTL formula
        at each node.  It works on all our examples, but we have no proof of
        correctness, and the simplification rules probably need some
        extension.

verifier.clp:
        A version of "verifier.tlp" (see below) that can be translated to
        "verifier.pl" by using "../../../coind/translate_colp".

verifier.tlp:
        A version of Gopal Gupta's elegant "interpreter for Linear Temporal
        Logic" (more specifically, a program that verifies whether a given
        LTL formula holds in a given state of a given automaton). It
        automatically negates the query and produces a counterexample if the
        query fails.

        The program contains both tabled and coinductive predicates (however,
        each predicate is either tabled or coinductive, not both). To execute
        it, just load an example that includes "verifier.tlp" into
        "dra". (See "../../README" for more information.)

        NOTE: Brian W. DeVries discovered that this program sometimes gives the
              wrong result. See the example in file "bwd_once_bitten.tlp".

verifier2.tlp:
        A version of verifier.tlp that does not use assert/retract and
        negation.  (NOTE: This is just for testing, there is no consistency
        checking.)

bwd_next_global.tlp:
bwd_future_and_fail.tlp:
bwd_once_bitten.tlp:
        Ingenious examples by Brian W. DeVries that demonstrate two different
        reasons why the old version of  "verifier.tlp" will not always work
        correctly.  The layout and comments slightly edited by F.K.
        The verifier has been modified to accomodate the first two examples.
        NOTE:
            The query q0 in bwd_once_bitten.tlp DOES NOT RUN PROPERLY with the
            current verifier: the result depends on the order of transitions.
            We suspect this is because the current execution strategy for
            coinduction is too simplistic.

bwd_next_global_v.tlp:
bwd_future_and_fail_v.tlp:
bwd_once_bitten_v.tlp:
        Versions of the bwd_... examples that run with v.pl.  They seem to
        run without problems.

consistency_checker.pl:
        A program that checks whether the definition of an automaton is
        internally consitent.  Used by the verifier.

looping_prefix.pl:
        A program that cuts off a prefix suitable for presentation from a
        path that is a counterexample.  Used by the verifier.

normalize.pl:
        Simple normalization of LTL expressions, used by the verifier.

operators.pl:
        Operator declarations, used by the verifier (and the normalizer).

partition_graph.pl:
        Finds the partitions of a graph. Used by consistency_checker.pl.

coind_example.pl:
coind_example.tlp:
coind_example_v.pl:
        A very simple example for the verifier. Tests proper working of
        coinduction.

errors.tlp:
errors.pl:
        A version of "example3" into which a number of errors have been
        introduced to test the diagnostics of the verifier.

example.pl:
example.tlp:
example_v.tlp:
        The definition of a simple automaton and some convenient LTL
        queries.

example2.pl:
example2.tlp:
example2_v.tlp:
        A somewhat more complex example similar to "example".

example3.pl:
example3.tlp:
example3_v.tlp:
        A smaller example.

example4.pl:
example4.tlp:
example4_v.tlp:
        A small example that attempts to catch a possible error in treating
        conjunctions when one conjunct is true along one path, and the other
        along another.

simple_example.tlp:
        A trivial example of a one-state automaton.

small_example.pl:
small_example.tlp:
small_example_v.tlp:
        An even smaller example, good for tracing while troubleshooting the
        tabling interpreter.

microwave.pl:
microwave.tlp:
microwave_v.tlp:
        Another example in the same spirit.  This one is actually a
        (somewhat simplified) model of a microwave oven.

microwave2.tlp:
        A version of microwave.tlp that uses verifier2.tlp instead of
        verifier.tlp.  Since negation is not allowed, explicit "notholds"
        facts have been added.

two_loops.tlp:
        A simple example of an automaton with three states.
