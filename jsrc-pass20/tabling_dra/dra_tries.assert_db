% The tables are normally kept in asserted clauses, but for some systems this
% is  not convenient, because asserted clauses are compiled.
% For example, this is so in SWI Prolog, which in addition does not assert
% cyclic terms, so  for that system the "recorded" database is more
% appropriate.
% In order to facilitate such changes, routines for handling the table is
% factored out of the main program.
