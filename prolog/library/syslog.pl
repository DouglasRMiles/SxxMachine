/** <module> Unix syslog interface

This library provides an interface to   the  Unix syslog() facility. The
interface is an almost direct translation of  the POSIX syslog API, with
two additions:

  - syslog/3 exploits format/3 to format syslog messages
  - The library integrates into library(debug) using
    prolog:debug_print_hook/3, where debug _topics_ are mapped to
    syslog _priorities_ and remaining debug _topics_ are mapped
    to the syslog _priority_ =debug=.

Note that this interface  makes  no   attempt  to  abstract over logging
facilities of operating systems. We expect   that such abstractions will
be implemented at the Prolog  level   using  multiple  integrations into
library(debug).

@see    detach_IO/1 to detach normal I/O of the process and remove it
        from the process group.
@see    fork/1 to create a daemon process.
@see    library(uid) to manage user identifiers (e.g., drop root
        privileges).

%!  openlog(+Ident:atom, +Options:list(atom), +Facility:atom) is det.
%
%   Open system log. This predicate provides a direct interface into
%   the openlog() library call. If the   library call is successful,
%   it runs at_halt(closelog) to ensure closing   the  system log on
%   clean exit.
%
%   @param  Ident prepended to every message, and is typically set
%           to the program name.
%   @param  Options is a list of options.  Values are corresponding
%           C options, after removing =LOG_= and translation to
%           lower case: =cons=, =ndelay=, =nowait=, =odelay=,
%           =perror=, =pid=.

%!  syslog(+Priority, +Message) is det.
%
%   Send a message to the system  log. Note that syslog/2 implicitly
%   opens a connection to the system log   if  such a connection has

%
%   @param  Priority is one of =emerg=, =alert=, =crit=, =err=,
%           =warning=, =notice=, =info= or =debug=.

%!  syslog(+Priority, +Format, +Args) is det.
%
%   Send a formatted message to the system  log if system logging is
%   opened using openlog/3. This predicate   combined  format/3 with
%   syslog/2. If there is no open  syslog connection, syslog/3 calls
%   print_message/2.
