/** <module> A TIPC Broadcast Bridge

SWI-Prolog's broadcast library provides a  means   that  may  be used to
facilitate publish and subscribe communication regimes between anonymous
members of a community of interest.  The   members  of the community are
however, necessarily limited to a single   instance  of Prolog. The TIPC
broadcast library removes that restriction.   With  this library loaded,
any member of a TIPC network that also  has this library loaded may hear
and respond to your broadcasts. Using TIPC Broadcast, it becomes a
nearly trivial matter to build an instance of supercomputer that
researchers within the High Performance Computer community refer to as
"Beowulf Class Cluster Computers."

This module has no public predicates. When this module is initialized,
it does three things:

    * It starts  a  listener  daemon   thread  that  listens for
    broadcasts from others, received as TIPC datagrams, and

    * It registers three listeners: tipc_node/1, tipc_cluster/1, and
    tipc_zone/1, and

    * It registers three listeners: tipc_node/2, tipc_cluster/2, and
    tipc_zone/2.

A broadcast/1 or broadcast_request/1 that is not  directed to one of the
six listeners above, behaves as usual and is confined to the instance of
Prolog that originated it. But when so   directed, the broadcast will be
sent to all participating systems, including   itself,  by way of TIPC's
multicast addressing facility. A TIPC broadcast or broadcast
request takes the typical form: =|broadcast(tipc_node(+Term,
+Timeout))|=. The principal functors =tipc_node=, =tipc_cluster=, and
=tipc_zone=, specify the scope of the broadcast. The functor
=tipc_node=, specifies that the broadcast is to be confined to members
of a present TIPC node. Likewise, =tipc_cluster= and =tipc_zone=,
specify that the traffic should be confined to members of a present TIPC
cluster and zone, respectively. To prevent the potential for feedback
loops, the scope qualifier is stripped from the message before
transmission. The timeout is optional. It specifies the amount to time
to wait for replies to arrive in response to a broadcast_request. The
default period is 0.250 seconds. The timeout is ignored for broadcasts.

An example of three separate processes cooperating on the same Node:

==
Process A:

   ?- listen(number(X), between(1, 5, X)).
   true.

   ?-

Process B:

   ?- listen(number(X), between(7, 9, X)).
   true.

   ?-

Process C:

   ?- findall(X, broadcast_request(tipc_node(number(X))), Xs).
   Xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9].

   ?-
==

It is also  possible  to  carry  on   a  private  dialog  with  a single
responder. To do this, you supply a   compound of the form, Term:PortId,
to a TIPC scoped broadcast/1 or broadcast_request/1, where PortId is the
port-id of the intended listener.  If   you  supply an unbound variable,
PortId, to broadcast_request, it will be unified with the address of the
listener that responds to Term. You may   send a directed broadcast to a
specific  member  by  simply  providing  this  address  in  a  similarly
structured compound to a TIPC scoped   broadcast/1.  The message is sent
via unicast to that  member  only  by   way  of  the  member's broadcast
listener. It is received by the  listener   just  as any other broadcast
would be. The listener does not know the difference.

Although this capability is needed under   some  circumstances, it has a
tendency to compromise the resilience of the broadcast model. You should
not rely on it too heavily, or fault tolerance will suffer.

For example, in order to discover who responded with a particular value:

==
Process A:

   ?- listen(number(X), between(1, 3, X)).
   true.

   ?-

Process B:

   ?- listen(number(X), between(7, 9, X)).
   true.

   ?-

Process C:

   ?- broadcast_request(tipc_node(number(X):From)).
   X = 7,
   From = port_id('<1.1.1:3971170279>') ;
   X = 8,
   From = port_id('<1.1.1:3971170279>') ;
   X = 9,
   From = port_id('<1.1.1:3971170279>') ;
   X = 1,
   From = port_id('<1.1.1:3971170280>') ;
   X = 2,
   From = port_id('<1.1.1:3971170280>') ;
   X = 3,
   From = port_id('<1.1.1:3971170280>') ;
   false.

## Caveats {#tipc-caveats}

While the implementation is mostly transparent, there are some important
and subtle differences that must be taken into consideration:

    * TIPC broadcast now requires an initialization step in order to
    launch the broadcast listener daemon. See tipc_initialize/0.

    * Prolog's broadcast_request/1 is nondet. It sends the request,
    then evaluates the replies synchronously, backtracking as needed
    until a satisfactory reply is received. The remaining potential
    replies are not evaluated. This is not so when TIPC is involved.

    * A TIPC broadcast/1 is completely asynchronous.

    * A  TIPC broadcast_request/1 is partially synchronous. A
    broadcast_request/1 is sent, then the sender balks for a period of
    time (default: 250 ms) while the replies are collected. Any reply
    that is received after this period is silently discarded. An
    optional second argument is provided so that a sender may specify
    more (or less) time for replies.

    * Replies are _|no longer|_ collected using findall/3. Replies are
    presented to the user as a choice point on arrival, until the
    broadcast request timer finally expires. This change allows
    traffic to propagate through the system faster and provides the
    requestor with the opportunity to terminate a broadcast request
    early if desired, by simply cutting choice points.

    * Please beware that broadcast request transactions will now remain
    active and resources consumed until broadcast_request finally fails
    on backtracking, an uncaught exception occurs, or until choice
    points are cut. Failure to properly manage this will likely result
    in chronic exhaustion of TIPC sockets.

    * If a listener is connected to a generator that always succeeds
    (e.g. a random number generator), then the broadcast request will
    never terminate and trouble is bound to ensue.

    * broadcast_request/1 with TIPC scope is _not_ reentrant (at
    least, not now anyway). If a listener performs a broadcast_request/1
    with TIPC scope recursively, then disaster looms certain. This
    caveat does not apply to a TIPC scoped broadcast/1, which can safely
    be performed from a listener context.

    * TIPC's capacity is not infinite. While TIPC can tolerate
    substantial bursts of activity, it is designed for short bursts of
    small messages. It can tolerate several thousand replies in response
    to a broadcast_request/1 without trouble, but it will begin to
    encounter congestion beyond that. And in congested conditions,
    things will start to become unreliable as TIPC begins prioritizing
    and/or discarding traffic.

    * A TIPC broadcast_request/1 term that is grounded is considered to
    be a broadcast only. No replies are collected unless the there is at
    least one unbound variable to unify.

    * A TIPC broadcast/1 always succeeds, even if there are no
    listeners.

    * A TIPC broadcast_request/1 that receives no replies will fail.

    * Replies may be coming from many different places in the network
    (or none at all). No ordering of replies is implied.

    * Prolog terms are sent to others after first converting them to
    atoms using term_to_atom/2. Passing real numbers this way may
    result in a substantial truncation of precision. See prolog flag
    option, 'float_format', of current_prolog_flag/2.

%  Here's a TIPC bridge to Prolog's broadcast library
%
%  A sender may confine a broadcast to  a   subset  of a TIPC network by
%  specifying a scoping qualifier in   his/her  broadcast. The qualifier
%  has the effect of selecting the   appropriate  multi-cast address for
%  the transmission. Thus, the sender of   the  message has control over
%  the scope of his/her traffic on a per-message basis.
%
%  All in-scope listeners receive the   broadcast and simply rebroadcast
%  the message locally. All broadcast replies, if any, are sent directly
%  to the sender via the port-id that   was received with the broadcast.
%  No additional multiplexing is required.

%    * Safety: For all possible outcomes, (\+P ; Q), is invariant.
